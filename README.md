# fourq:babel

Turn ES6 code into readable vanilla ES5 with source maps

All transpiled code will include an inline sourcemap.

[http://babeljs.io/](http://babeljs.io/)

# Install

meteor add fourq:babel

# Usage

Any file you'd like to use fourq:babel on, just change the .js extension to .babel.js.

* Unfortunately, Meteor's isobuild doesn't allow another file handler to handle the .js extenstion atm.


# Comparison to other transpilers
